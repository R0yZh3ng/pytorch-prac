most popular deep learning framework

write fast deep learning code in python (able to run on a gpu/gpus)

access to prebuilt deep learning models in torchhub /torchvision.models. (transfer learning)

whole stack: preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application/cloud

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and applciation programming interface that allows softeware to use certain types of graphics processing unit for general purpose processing 

Tensor - numerically encoded data that is passed into hidden layers that will perform mathematical operations on the tensors and will output another tensor that will be translated into something that humans can understand

Covering:

  - pytorch basic and fundamentals(tensors and tensor operations)
  - preprocessing data (getting data into tensors)
  - building and using pretrained deep learning models
  - fitting a model to the data(learning patterns)
  - making predictions with a model(using patterns)
  - evaluating model predictions
  - saving and loading models
  - usinga trained model to make predictions on custom data

** The General pytorch workflow **

1. get the data ready(turn into tensors)
2. build or pick a pretrained model to suit the problem
  - pick a loss function and optimizer
  - build a training loop
3. fit the model to the data and make a prediction
4. evaluate the model
5. improve through experimentation
6. save and reload trained model
