Traditional programming takes in inputs, rules and produces output
Machine learning algorithm takes in inputs, outputs and comes up with the rules given the relationships between inputs and outputs

Use machine learning over traditional when dealing with complex problems that would result in difficulty coming up with all the rules.

Deep learning is good fro problesm wiht long lists of rules
                      continually changing enviroments and changing scenarios
                      discovering insights within large collections of data

not good for problems that need explainability
            when the tradional approach is a better option
            when errors are unacceptable
            when you dont have much data

machine learning is structured data, deep learning is unstructured data

**Neural Network**

input layer: takes in data
hidden layers: learns patterns in data
output layers: outputs learned representation or prediction probabilities

each layer is usually combinations of linear and non linear functions (where linear algebra would help a lot)

supervised learning: having data and labels and examples
unsupervised learning: only having the data, learn a fundamental pattern of certain things and come up with its own rules
transfer learning: transfering knowledge already learned from one model to another
reinforcement learning: agent performs action and recieves feedback and rewards from the enviroment and learn by optimizing the reward

deep learning use cases
computer vision, voice recognition, search recommendation, natural language processing

sequence to sequence where there is a input and a output
regression/classification where predicts next data point based on provided data
